# GeneXus BeforeUnload User Control

A GeneXus User Control that enables the programmer to show a dialog box when users navigate out of a page, giving users the option to stay on the current page.

In addition, it can be used to execute the Enter event before leaving the page.

This control is useful when, in a Web Panel or Transaction where the user fills many form fields, we want to prevent the user from leaving or reloading the page by mistake.

### Installing

1. Download the files and place them under %GX_PROGRAM_DIR%\UserContorls\BeforeUnload
2. Run genexus.exe /install
3. Open GeneXus and drag the control from the toolbox and drop it anywhere in the form of an object. The place where you drop it within the form is not important, as the control has no visual behavior.
